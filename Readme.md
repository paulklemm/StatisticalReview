# Statistical Analyses of VAST'14 and VAST'15 Publications.

As part of my thesis "Interactive Visual Analysis of Population Study Data", I've conducted several statistical analyses of the hypotheses generated in the publications "[Interactive Visual Analysis of Image-Centric Cohort Study Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346591)" and "[3D Regression Heat Map Analysis of Population Study Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468291)."

The analyses are carried out using `R` and are available as `R Markdown` `HTML` documents.
